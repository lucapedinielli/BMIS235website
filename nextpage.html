    <h1>Foods I like to cook</h1>
    <p> I'm always looking for a new recipe to make or restaunt to try.
        This page will talk about some of my favroites. I am a huge fan of grilling 
        some burgers and hotdogs during the summer, When autum comes I will start making 
        soup and stews I have been a huge fan of beef stew and potato chowder recently. 
        During winter I make a lot of slowcooker meals and pasta dishes. Finally when 
        spring time comes I make a lot of smoothies and some fruit salads.
